**DOI2BibTeX Fetcher** is a lightweight, Python-based GUI application designed to fetch BibTeX entries for DOIs (Digital Object Identifiers). With its modern interface and intuitive design, it simplifies citation management by offering customization options such as including/excluding abstracts, saving entries to files, and copying entries to the clipboard.



## **Features**

- Fetch BibTeX entries for one or more DOIs.
- Optionally include or exclude the abstract from BibTeX entries.
- Copy fetched BibTeX entries directly to the clipboard for easy use.
- Restart the application to input new DOIs.
- Save BibTeX references to a `.bib` file.
- **Auto-Save**: Automatically save BibTeX entries after fetching.
- **Select Save Location**: You can now choose the location to save the file.
- Clean and modern GUI for a seamless user experience.

### 2. **Enter DOIs**
Input one or more DOIs using these formats:
- Space-separated: `10.1234/example1 10.5678/example2`

### 3. **Fetch BibTeX**
